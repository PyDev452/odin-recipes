        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3/4 cup rice vinegar</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons water</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons white sugar</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons sesame seeds</li>
            <li>1 small carrot, cut into matchsticks</li>
            <li>1/4 large English cucumber, cut into matchsticks</li>
            <li>1/4 small red onion, cut into 1/8-inch thick wedges</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk together 3/4 cups rice vinegar, water, sugar, and sesame seeds in a small bowl until sugar is dissolved. Add carrot, cucumber, and red onion, separating onion layers; toss to coat. Chill until ready to use, stirring occasionally to keep vegetables submerged in the brine.</li>
            <li>Whisk together mayonnaise, Thai sweet chile sauce, Sriracha, 1 teaspoon rice vinegar, and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a small bowl. Chill Bang Bang Sauce until ready to use.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil.</li>
            <li>Toss mushrooms with 1 tablespoon oil. Spread mushrooms out in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet. Roast mushrooms in the preheated oven for 15 minutes, stirring halfway through. Remove from oven and allow to cool.            </li>
            <li>Toss mushrooms with 1 tablespoon oil. Spread mushrooms out in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet. Roast mushrooms in the preheated oven for 15 minutes, stirring halfway through. Remove from oven and allow to cool.            </li>
            <li>Transfer cooked mushrooms to a food processor,pulsing 5 or 6 times and scraping down the sides of the bowl, until finely minced (or mince with a knife). Combine mushrooms, ground chicken,  and 1 1/4 teaspoons salt in a bowl; mix thoroughly, without overmixing. </li>
            <li>When ready to cook the burgers, set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Place jalapeño halves, cut side down, and green onions on a baking sheet. Drizzle with 1 teaspoon oil. </li>
            <li>Broil vegetables until charred, turning halfway through, about 10 minutes. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, preheat a large cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. Brush skillet with 1 teaspoon oil and toast brioche buns, cut side down, until lightly browned, 2 to 4 minutes; set aside.</li>
            <li>Lightly whisk eggs and water in a shallow dish. Add panko bread crumbs to a second dish. Gently dip burger patties into egg mixture, letting excess drip off. Press lightly into bread crumbs to coat both sides.</li>
            <li>Heat remaining oil in a cast iron skillet over medium heat. Fry burgers until internal temperature reaches 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), about 3 minutes per side. Place patties on a plate lined with paper towels.</li>
            <li>Spread a light layer of Bang Bang sauce on bottom buns. Add 2 charred jalapeño halves per bun. Add chicken patty and top with slaw and charred scallions. Top with cilantro and drizzle with more sauce.</li>
        </ol>
